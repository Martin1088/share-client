# Connector

The Connector (or "Samply Share Client" or "Teiler" ) connects the [Blaze](https://github.com/life-research/blaze) store and the central Sample-Locator which consists of two modules, [UI](https://github.com/samply/sample-locator) and [backend](https://github.com/samply/share-broker-rest), as part of the [Bridgehead-Deployment](https://github.com/samply/bridgehead-deployment).

To register a Searchbroker/Sample.Locator, see [adminpage.md](/docs/adminpage.md) and also the [implementaion guide](https://samply.github.io/bbmri-fhir-ig/howtoJoin.html) for the general requirements.
