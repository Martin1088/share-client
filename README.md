# Connector

To make samples easily accessible for researcher to help [making new treatments possible.](http://www.bbmri-eric.eu/)




The Connector (or "Samply Share Client" or "Teiler" ) connects [Store](https://github.com/bbmride/store) and [Searchbroker](https://github.com/bbmride/searchbroker) as part of the [GBA-Bridgehead](https://github.com/bbmride/gba-bridgehead).

You can access the Connector under http://localhost:8082 and login under <http://localhost:8082/login.xhtml> (default credentials are **admin**, **adminpass**). If the Store runs while logging in the first time, the default credentials of the Store get deactivated. From now on, Connector and Store share the same credentials.

Register a Searchbroker under <http://localhost:8082/admin/broker_list.xhtml>

- Broker Adresse = <https://search.germanbiobanknode.de/broker/>
- Ihre Email Adresse = your email address to get the API-Key for registration
- Automatisch antworten = Nur Anzahl (default, so you answer automatically with number of samples)

You will receive an email with API-key generated by our Searchbroker, paste these eight numbers into the provided field and press "ok". Contact us by sending an email from the registered email address to itc_intern@germanbiobanknode.de and let us know the name of your Biobank. An ITC will validate your request so researcher can find your samples.

To see all executed queries, or to create new credentials for the [import](https://github.com/bbmride/store/import/IMPORT.md) into [Store](https://github.com/bbmride/store), create a new user at <http://localhost:8082/admin/user_list.xhtml>, logout, and login as normal user.

If you have any problem or suggestion, [create an issue](https://github.com/bbmride/connector/issues/new)

## Build

Requirements:

- [Java 8](#java)
- [Database](#database)
- Maven

```
git clone https://github.com/bbmride/connector
cd connector
mvn install -Psamply
```



## Run ([Docker](#docker) or [Manual](#manual))

### Docker

Use the Docker-Compose of the [GBA-Bridgehead](https://github.com/bbmride/gba-bridgehead) and run only the Connector with:

```
docker-compose up connector
```



### Manual

Requirements:

- [Database](#database)
- [Tomcat](#tomcat)
- The Connector webapp as .war file: [build yourselve](#build) or download from release tab of Github



Steps:

- Delete folder ${tomcat.home}/webapps/ROOT.
- Rename .war file to ROOT.war
- Copy ROOT.war to ${tomcat.home}/webapps/ 

Start tomcat by executing ${tomcat.home}/bin/startup.sh (Windows: startup.bat) or by running the tomcat-service if you [created one.](#tomcat-service-for-autostart)



## Environment

### Database

The Open-Source database Postresql 9.6 is used. The database connection uses the connection pool of Tomcat. 

This webapp needs schema '**samply**' in the database '**samply.connector**' under user '**samply**' and password '**samply**' under port `5432`. 

To change these settings during build, search for these values in the **src/pom.xml** and adapt to your needs.
During run, see context.xml (described under [Configurations](#Configurations)).



- Follow installation for port **5432**

  - Windows: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
  - Linux Mint:

  ```
  sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ xenial-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/postgresql.list'
  
  wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
  
  sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.6
  ```

  ​	Other Linux:

  ```
  sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $(lsb_release -sc)-pgdg main"
  
  wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
  
  sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.6
  ```

- Create database and user:

  - pgAdmin installed: Having Server opened, under "Databases": rightclick on "Login/Group Roles". Select "Create"?"Login/Group Role". Tab Generel: Enter Name. Tab Definition: Enter Password. Tab Privileges: enable "Can Login?" and "Superuser". By creating new Databases, select this user as "Owner"*

  - command line: 

    ```
    (sudo su postgres)
    psql
    CREATE DATABASE "samply.searchbroker";
    CREATE USER samply WITH PASSWORD 'samply';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "samply.searchbroker" to samply;
    ```



### Tomcat

Requirements:

- [Java 8](#java)

  

1. Download and unzip: http://mirror.funkfreundelandshut.de/apache/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.38/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.38.zip (eg. to /opt/tomcat-connector)

2. Change ports: Every webapp has its own tomcat, so change ports for Store-Tomcat in ${tomcat.base}/conf/server.xml:

   ```
   ...
   ...<connector port="8082" protocol="HTTP/1.1" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8102" />...
   ...
   ...<connector port="8002" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8102" /> ...
   ...
   ...<Server port="8202" shutdown="SHUTDOWN">...
   ...
   ```



### Java

Is a dependency of tomcat,

if you install different jre versions on this machine, set jre 8 for tomcat by creating a so called "setenv.sh".

Linux: [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/)

Windows: [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) 



### Configurations

These configuration files are used:

```
src/main/java/webapp/WEB-INF/conf/
(log4j2.xml, mailSending.xml, samply_bridgehead_info.xml, samply_common_config.xml, samply_common_operator.xml, samply_common_urls.xml)

src/main/java/webapp/META-INF/
(context.xml)
```

The context.xml will be auto-copied by tomcat at startup to ${tomcat.base}/conf/Catalina/localhost/ROOT.xml.
This file will not be overwritten by updating the WAR file due to tomcat settings.

All files under WEB-INF/conf will always be found from FileFinder as ultimate fallback.

If you want to save your configurations, copy all files under WEB-INF/conf (tomcat or code source) to ${tomcat.base}/conf.

According to the predefinded log4j2.xml, all logs can be found in ${tomcat.base}/logs/connector.

**IntelliJ** creates a *tomcat.base* directory for every startup of the application. So save your configuration files to *tomcat.home* and it will copy these files and logs every time to *tomcat.base*. You will see the paths at startup in the first lines of the console output.



### Connections

To use a **proxy**, set your url in file **samply_common_config.xml**.



Ingoing (secured with basic auth):

```
GET /inquiries/active
GET /inquiries/archived
GET /inquiries/erroneous
GET /inquiries/log
```



Outgoing:

```
STORE/testAuth
STORE/saveOrUpdateUser

STORE/requests
STORE/result
STORE/stats
STORE/info

SEARCHBROKER/rest/searchbroker/banks/{bankemail} (register, activate and unregister)
SEARCHBROKER/rest/searchbroker/inquiries
SEARCHBROKER/rest/searchbroker/inquiries/{inquiryid}
SEARCHBROKER/rest/searchbroker/inquiries/{inquiryid}/replies/{bankemail}

SEARCHBROKER/rest/test/inquiries/{inquiryid}
SEARCHBROKER/referencequery
SEARCHBROKER/rest/monitoring

```



### Productive Settings

#### Tomcat service for autostart

​	Linux:

​		Remember path of output:

```
sudo update-java-alternatives -l

```

​		Create new service file:

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tomcat-connector.service

```

​		Copy the remembered path to JAVA_HOME and add `/jre` to the end of this 		path, also check tomcat path:

```
[Unit]
Description=Apache Tomcat Web Application Container
After=network.target

[Service]

Environment=JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/jre

Environment=CATALINA_BASE=/opt/tomcat-connector
Environment='CATALINA_OPTS=-Xms512M -Xmx1024M -server -XX:+UseParallelGC'
Environment='JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.awt.headless=true -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom'

ExecStart=/opt/tomcat-connector/bin/startup.sh
ExecStop=/opt/tomcat-connector/bin/shutdown.sh

User=tomcat

```



​	Windows: 

​		Follow installer: http://ftp.fau.de/apache/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.38/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.38.exe

​		And check service (one per app/tomcat): http://www.ansoncheunghk.info/article/5-steps-install-multiple-apache-tomcat-instance-windows
